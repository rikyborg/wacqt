Why signal not symmetric around zero?

From the templates, construct two orthonormal vectors (something like subtract |g> and |e>-<g|e>), then try again.

Try with pen and paper on simple vectors, on complex numbers, and on complex vectors.

Or is it better to calculate distance rather than projection?

Get threshould from templates! midway between <e-g|e> and <e-g|g> probably.
